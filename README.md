# Branch Deck

**üí° Consider [GitButler](https://gitbutler.com) first**

Branch Deck is a workaround for [performance](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/3235) 
[issues](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/9018) with GitButler on large repositories.

Automatically create Git branches from commits with prefixed messages. Organize your work into separate branches without manual branch management.

## What It Does

Branch Deck creates Git branches from your commits based on message prefixes. Commits with the same prefix get cherry-picked into their own dedicated branch.

## How It Works

Branch Deck analyzes your commit history and creates separate branches based on commit message patterns. There are two distinct kinds of ‚Äúprefixes‚Äù to be aware of:

- Commit message grouping prefix: Text like `(feature-auth)` at the start of a commit subject. This is used only to group commits on the main branch (HEAD). It is not persisted on virtual/archived branches and not present after integration into main.
- Branch prefix (git config): The namespace (e.g. `username`) configured via `git config branchdeck.branchPrefix`. This becomes the first path segment under `refs/heads`, e.g. `refs/heads/username/...`.

### Explicit Prefixes (commit messages)
Use the `(name)` format in your commit messages on main:
- Commits prefixed with `(feature-auth)` are grouped into a virtual branch at `username/virtual/feature-auth`
- Commits prefixed with `(bugfix-login)` are grouped into `username/virtual/bugfix-login`

When Branch Deck creates or updates those virtual branches, the cherry-picked commit subjects are stored without the grouping prefix (e.g. `Add login`, not `(feature-auth) Add login`).

### Issue Numbers
If no explicit prefix is found, Branch Deck automatically detects issue numbers (e.g., `JIRA-123`, `ABC-456`) in the first line of the commit message on main:
- Commits with `IJPL-163558: Fix observability` are grouped into `username/virtual/IJPL-163558`
- Commits with `[threading] IJPL-163558: Fix observability` also go to `username/virtual/IJPL-163558`
- Square bracket prefixes like `[subsystem]` are ignored when grouping by issue numbers
- Multiple commits with the same issue number are grouped together
- Issue numbers must be in the first line of the commit message

### Priority
- Explicit prefixes `(name)` take precedence over issue numbers
- Commits without either pattern remain on the main branch

### Virtual and Archived Branch Layout
See [docs/design/virtual-branches.md](docs/design/virtual-branches.md) for details about branch structure and storage.

This allows you to maintain a clean, organized Git history while working on multiple features simultaneously.

### Current Limitations

- Sub-branches not yet supported: Nested branch structures (e.g., `(feature-auth/oauth)`) are not currently implemented.

## Why Branch Deck?

- **Simple**: Just add `(name)` prefixes or use issue numbers in your commit messages
- **Automatic**: Creates actual Git branches without manual branch management
- **Organized**: Each feature gets its own clean branch automatically
- **Flexible**: Work on multiple features simultaneously in one working directory
